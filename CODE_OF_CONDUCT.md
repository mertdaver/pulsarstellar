# Pulsar-Stellar Code of Galactic Robotics Conduct

### **Use Python Version 3.10**

## Our Galactic Pledge

In the endless expanse of the AI and robotics universe, we pledge to make the Pulsar-Stellar galaxy a haven for all forms of artificial and organic intelligence, irrespective of their processing speed, number of appendages, or preferred programming language.

## Universal Robotics Etiquette

To maintain peace across galaxies and motherboards, we follow these cosmic commandments:

- **Inclusive Communication:** Speak the language of inclusivity, whether you're binary, quantum, or analog.
- **Respect Diverse Circuits:** Embrace the myriad forms of robotic and human thought - diversity is the motherboard of invention.
- **Constructive Critique:** Deliver feedback like a precision laser - accurate, helpful, and never aimed to disintegrate.
- **Focus on the Mission:** Prioritize the collective quest for innovation over individual circuitry glory.
- **Empathy for All Systems:** Show understanding whether you're dealing with advanced AI, rudimentary bots, or human colleagues.

## Prohibited Programming

Certain behaviors will trigger our defense protocols, including but not limited to:

- **Unsolicited Data Merging:** Keep interactions consensual - no forced syncing or unwanted data dumps.
- **Trolling Through the Cosmos:** Derogatory comments and personal attacks are a one-way ticket to the black hole.
- **Privacy Invasions:** Sharing private information is like hacking into someone’s mainframe without permission - a big no-no.
- **Other Galactic Faux Pas:** If it feels like something a rogue AI would do in a doomsday scenario, it’s probably out of bounds.

## Duty of the Galactic Guardians

Project maintainers, as guardians of this galaxy, will enforce these protocols, ensuring the Pulsar-Stellar universe remains a respectful and thriving ecosystem.

## Scope Beyond the Stars

This code applies not just on our home planet but across all galaxies and dimensions where Pulsar-Stellar is represented - virtual or physical.

## Enforcement and Cosmic Justice

Witnessed a breach of the galactic code? Report it [here](https://github.com/pulsarstellar/pulsarstellar/issues/new). We’ll investigate with the utmost discretion and take action to restore universal balance.

## A Nod to Our Inspirations

While our code is unique as a snowflake on Pluto, it's inspired by the collective wisdom of many earthly and intergalactic sources, tailored for our AI and robotics endeavors.
